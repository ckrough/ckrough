# Hello!

I'm **Chris Krough**, `ckrough` on the socials.

## `Who I Am`

**Engineering Leader** shaping engineering orgs, development workflows, and platform architectures<br/>
**Animal Advocate** fostering, training, and walking rescue dogs (and tending to cats)<br/>
**Fueled by** optimizing complex systems (people or tech) and the occasional mass migration

**Some things I've done:**
- Refactored engineering platforms to improve developer experience, reliability, and security.
- Migrated hundreds of services across half a dozen cloud environments with zero downtime
- Scaled a platform through >6,000% revenue growth and $3B in transactions
- Built telemetry across hundreds of Kubernetes clusters on multiple continents
